## Know Your Plant Android application

This application is part of our academic project for the course Machine Learning. This application is built using the Kivy framework. For example, users can upload a photograph of a leaf of their garden plant; not only will it classify the category of the leaf, but it will also give the plant's health status. For example, if a plant has any disease, it will notify the user. Also, one can upload a photograph of a flower, and this application will also detect the flower category.
